# Step 0 â€“ Terraform Concepts

Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that allows you to manage cloud and local resources declaratively.

Key concepts:

- **Terraform CLI**: Command-line tool to execute Terraform commands.
- **Providers**: Plugins that allow Terraform to interact with APIs (e.g., AWS, Apigee, Local).
- **Configuration files**: `.tf` files define the infrastructure you want to create.
- **State**: Terraform keeps track of resources it manages in a state file.
- **Modules**: Reusable blocks of Terraform code.

> In the next steps, you'll practice with three different providers: Local, Apigee, and AWS.
